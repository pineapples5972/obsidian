# Jenkins Debian Packages

This is the Debian package repository of Jenkins to automate installation and upgrade. To use this repository, first add the key to your system (for the Weekly Release Line):

`sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \     [https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key](https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key)`
  

Then add a Jenkins apt repository entry:

`echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \     https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \     /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null`
  

Update your local package index, then finally install Jenkins:

````
sudo apt-get update
````

````
sudo apt-get install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
````

````
sudo apt-get install jenkins
````

Check if jenkins is running, if it's not running then run below command
`sudo systemctl status jenkins`

 enable the jenkins service
`sudo systemctl enable jenkins`
