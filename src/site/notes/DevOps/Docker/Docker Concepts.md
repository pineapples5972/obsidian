## Basics
#### What is container?
- its layers of images
- Linux based image
- and application image on top

#### What is Docker?
It manages containers!

#### What is Docker Images?
It is kind of a readonly filesystem or say CD Disk like a ISO from which we can run a container.
#### How to create Image?

##### Option 1: Using Dockerfile

#### Dockerfile
```
FROM Ubuntu
 1. OS - Ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
2. Update apt repo
RUN apt-get install python
RUN pip install flask
 3. Install dependencies using apt
RUN pip install flask-mysql
4. Install Python dependencies using pip
COPY . /opt/source-code
ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/source-code/app.py flask run
``` 

`docker build Dockerfile –t yourusername/my-custom-app`
`docker push yourusername/my-custom-app` 
_This will upload your dockerfile to docker registory online such as dockerhub.io_

#### Docker Registry

`docker run nginx`
_In this case nginx is repository name where it pull from the remote location such docker hub.
When user give image name to pull it actually expect account name and repo name like this:_
`docker run nginx/nginx`
_In this case first nginx is account name and second is repo name. When user type of only one name i.e. `docker run nginx` it assumes that both account name and repo name is that same name._
##### Public Registry
There are popular public docker repositories:
- gcr.io - google repository
- hub.docker.io - dockers official repository  
##### Private Registry
There are self hosted or private registries to chose from incase you dont want public exposure. Many cloud providers gives you private registries :
- AWS
- Azure
- JCP

To run a container from private registry you need to first login to with following command :
`docker login private-registry.io`

then you can run your private repository:
`docker run private-registry.io/apps/internal-app`

#### Deploy private registry
What if you running your application on premise and dont have private registry how do you deploy your own private registry within your organization:

The docker registry is itself is an application and it available inside docker image. The name of the image is registry. It exposes the api on port 5000.

`docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2`
Now that you have your custom registry running on port 5000 on  how do you push your own image to it.

`docker image tag my-name localhost:5000/my-image`

`docker push localhost:5000/my-image`

Now you can pull this image anywhere within this network with server name i.e. localhost or ip address of the host.

`docker pull localhost:5000/my-image`

`docker pull 192.168.56.100:5000/my-image`

**Example:**
_To push some images into our locally hosted registry we can first pull then, tag them and then push them like this:_
Pulling:
`docker pull nginx:latest` 
then Tagging:
`docker image tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest` 
and finally push it: 
`docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest`.  
To check the list of images pushed , use: `curl -X GET localhost:5000/v2/_catalog`

To remove all locally non running images
`docker image prune -a`

Now we can pull images from our `registry-server` as well. Use `docker pull [server-addr/image-name]` to pull the images that we pushed earlier.

In our case we can use: `docker pull localhost:5000/nginx`
